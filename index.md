# Hello World!

## Introduction

## My Background

## Work Projects

List of projects for work. Deliberately generalized to remove any potentially sensitive information.

* For a well-known American technology company. Project uses descriptive statistics to quantify the performance difference in manufacturing and end-product functionality when there is a supply chain change for one of the key functional components. This is done for a particular product family that encompases more than 200 SKUs (Store Keeping Units). This is done to validate that the new material supply does not cause any unexpected effects in the fairly mature production lines.
* *In progress* Same company as above. Using descriptive analytical techniques to model and understand an intermittent type of failure in the manufacturing process. This is done on the same product line as the previous project.

## Learnings

This sections lists the trainings that I've participated in my Data Science journey. I will include any links if these trainings include any exercises that can be shared.

* [Tutorials](https://github.com/azmimr/tutorials) The objective for me with these are to either a) have a quick introduction to a new topic or b) refresher on topics which I may not have touched in a while. What are uploaded are just my effors, not the full tutorials. The README will contain additional information including the original tutorial link if you are interested in trying them yourself.

## Personal Projects

As someone who managed and delivered technical trainings for many years, I am aware how active learning is important in building and reinforcing competencies. The challenge in learning any discipline is to attempt problems outside of the sanitized environment of training. This is where you can push the boundaries of your understanding and discover the limitations of knowledge. This allows you to than seek new knowledge which allows to tackle even more complex or different problems. 

The projects listed here don't fit under the Learnings section above. They are more 'stand-alone', open-ended exercises with potentially no clear solutions. The projects can be self-created ones which are of personal interests to me, or they could be the more complicated tutorials found where I try to push the data to the limits of my own understanding (I hopefully should return to them whenever I build new skills). Eventually I hope to take part in some competitions to see how I stack up with the Community.

* **Analysis of Public Housing Prices in Singapore** This project attempts to explore and eventually model the prices for public housing in Singapore.
    * *Phase 1 - In Progress* Data Gathering, Exploration and simple Linear regression modelling of currently available public data.
    * *Phase 2* Incorporating macroeconomic data to help improve the model. Example of data could be GDP, Median salaries, CPI etc.
    * *Phase 3* Attempt other ML techniques e.g. GAM (for non-linear regression), SVMs, Neural Nets etc.

## Resources

These are a list of resources that I find interesting in the Data Science space. There are definitely more comprehensive lists that can be found on-line and I am definitely not trying to create another one of those at the moment.
