# Hello World!

## Introduction

## My Background

## Learnings

This sections lists the trainings that I've participated in my Data Science journey. I will include any links if these trainings include any exercises that can be shared.

## Projects

As someone who managed and delivered technical trainings for many years, I am aware how active learning is important in building and reinforcing competencies. The challenge in learning any discipline is to attempt problems outside of the sanitized environment of training. This is where you can push the boundaries of your understanding and discover the limitations of knowledge. This allows you to than seek new knowledge which allows to tackle even more complex or different problems. 

The projects listed here don't fit under the Learnings section above. They are more 'stand-alone', open-ended exercises with potentially no clear solutions. The projects can be self-created ones which are of personal interests to me, or they could be the more complicated tutorials found where I try to push the data to the limits of my own understanding (I hopefully should return to them whenever I build new skills). Eventually I hope to take part in some competitions to see how I stack up with the Community.

## Resources

These are a list of resources that I find interesting in the Data Science space. There are definitely more comprehensive lists that can be found on-line and I am definitely not trying to create another one of those at the moment.
